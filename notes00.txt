Basic elements of file input:
The function open() creates and returns a file handle

obligatory argument: a file name (or a complete path)

optional: a string representing the mode in which the file is opened

optional: a string representing the encoding of the file (see below)

Example: open(“guide.txt”, “r”)

The default mode if no other is specified: “r” (“reading” – opens a file for reading only).
Other options:
“w” (“writing” – opens a file for writing only. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for writing).
“a” (“appending” – opens a file for appending. New content is appended to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for writing).
“x” (“creating” – creates a file and opens it. Fails if a file by that name already exists).

Additional specifiers to the mode: “+” (r+ = read and write, w+ = write and read, a+ = append and read), “b” (rb/wb/ab = read/write/append in binary format)
